## Static Typing Required

Here is a refresher of basic built-in types.

```python
from typing import List, Set, Dict, Tuple, Optional  # Builtins
from typing import Callable, Iterator, Union  # Functions
from typing import Any, AnyStr, cast  # Advanced

# For simple built-in types, just use the name of the type
x: int = 1
x: float = 1.0
x: bool = True
x: str = "test"
x: bytes = b"test"
```
